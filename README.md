## Overview

This Python script implements a simple two-step authentication process using a password and an OTP (One-Time Password). The system first verifies the user's password, and if correct, sends an OTP to the user's phone number via the Twilio API. The user must then input the correct OTP to successfully log in. The script includes basic error handling and limits the number of password attempts to avoid brute-force attacks.

## Features

- **Password Authentication**: The user must enter the correct password to proceed to the OTP verification.
- **OTP Generation**: Upon correct password entry, the system generates a 6-digit OTP.
- **Twilio Integration**: OTP is sent to the user's phone number via Twilio's messaging service.
- **Login Verification**: The user is prompted to enter the OTP, which must match the generated OTP to successfully log in.
- **Max Attempt Limit**: The script limits the number of password attempts to a defined maximum to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes try-except blocks for handling potential errors during OTP generation and sending, as well as while receiving user input.

## Workflow

1. **Password Verification**:
   - The user is prompted to enter the password.
   - If the password is correct, the system proceeds to the OTP generation step.
   - If the password is incorrect, the system will notify the user and allow a defined number of attempts (`max_attempts`).

2. **OTP Generation**:
   - If the password is correct, the system generates a random 6-digit OTP.
   - The OTP is sent to the user's phone number using Twilio's messaging API.

3. **OTP Verification**:
   - The user is asked to input the OTP they received.
   - If the OTP matches the generated OTP, the user is successfully logged in.
   - If the OTP is incorrect, the login attempt is denied.

4. **Lockout Mechanism**:
   - If the user exceeds the allowed number of password attempts (`max_attempts`), they will be locked out from the system.
